# My Personal NeoVim Config.

Here are some notes below you should know before using this config.

For one, I use bob, which is a version control manager for NVim. Secondly, I use the nightly version of NVim, in particular that is V0.12.0. Also, please be sure to check each plugins respective github repo for build requirements.

I will be continuing to update this NVimConfig as I get more comfortable. Lastly, note that this config is fairly barebones... as is my linux/NVim knowledge (for now!).
